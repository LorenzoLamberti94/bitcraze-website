## A powerful platform for research
---

#### Flexible

The Crazyflie is the ideal tool for research in areas such as control algorithms,
swarms, path finding, agriculture or failure recovery. The platform is designed to be as
flexible and versatile as possible to enable the user to explore the area of interest.

#### Extendable

Add new sensors or other hardware to support your needs; the expansion port supports a variety
of interfaces and there is plenty of power in the processors for you to use. If you need
more lifting capacity, use the BigQuad deck and move your application to a bigger frame,
while still being able to develop it in the comfort of your lab.

#### Tools

The Crazyflie can be controlled from a number of programming languages and also integrates with
tools and frameworks such as ROS or ZeroMQ. It works well with standard development tools to make
your work a breeze.

#### Open source

The entire firmware is open for you to change, you will never be locked in by limited APIs or closed
 software. Never.
