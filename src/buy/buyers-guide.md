any hardware you like. When prototyping the Breakout deck is useful as you can
use it to connect your Crazyflie 2.X to a bread board and easily debug your
hardware design. When satisfied with the design you can transfer it to a Prototyping
deck for a more permanent implementation. If you want to take it even further,
why not manufacture a [deck PCB](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie2-exp-template-electronics) and add Female deck connectors.

**What to buy:** [Breakout deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/breakout-deck),
[Prototyping deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/prototyping-deck),
[Female deck connectors](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/female-deck-connector)

## I want to paint in the dark with a Crazyflie

The Crazyflie 2.X is fun to fly as is but adding the LED-ring deck and flying
in the dark adds a new dimension. The RGB LEDs lets you chose any colour and with
some coding any light sequence can be displayed, for instance controlled by the
on board sensors.
Why not take photos with an open shutter of a moving Crayflie 2.X and paint in
the dark?

**What to buy:** [The LED-ring deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/led-ring-deck)

## I want the Crazyflie to give feedback using sound and light

The LED-ring deck can be used to display light in any color and the Buzzer deck
can make sounds, useful for giving the user feedback. For automated implementation
it can be very handy to indicate when the system is ready, error states or similar.

**What to buy:** [The Artist bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/the-estetik-bundle-1),
[the Buzzer deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/buzzer-deck)

## I want a bigger Crazyflie 2.X

The BigQuad deck is used to control a bigger quad copter frame with a Crazyflie 2.X.
Remove the motors on the Crazyflie, add the BigQuad deck and mount it on a bigger
frame. Connect the motor controllers (ESCs) for the brushless motors of the frame
to the BigQuad deck and you are ready to go. You get the full ecosystem of the
Crazyflie 2.X but super sized.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle),
[BigQuad deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/bigquad-deck)

Note: the bigger frame, brushless motors and ESCs are not included

## I want wireless charging of my Crazyflie

The Qi deck gives the Crazyflie wireless charging capabilities. The battery is
automatically charged when the Crazyflie 2.X is placed on top of a wireless charger,
no need to connect a cable.

**What to buy:** [Qi wireless charging deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/qi-1-2-wireless-charging-deck)

Note: wireless charger not included

## I want to record data when flying my Crazyflie 2.X

If large volumes of data needs to be recorded when flying, the Crazyradio PA might
not have sufficient bandwidth in some cases. The SD-card deck adds access to the
filesystem of a SD card and enables storage of any data.

**What to buy:** [SD-card deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/sd-card-deck)

Note: SD card is not included

## I want to use a SD-card for configuration of a Crazyflie

The SD-card deck can be used to store configuration data for a Crazyflie. An
example could be an autonomous implementation where the Crazyflie is not connected
via radio. The configuration can be written to a SD-card in a computer and the
SD-card is transferred to the Crazyflie before it is started. This is also a
way to separate configuration from hardware/firmware and avoid flashing
different firmware to Crazyflie individuals.

**What to buy:** [SD-card deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/sd-card-deck)

Note: SD card is not included

## I want assistance when flying the Crazyflie

Flying a quad copter like the Crazyflie manually requires some skill and
practising. By adding the Z-ranger deck or Flow deck the Crazyflie gets more
information about its motion and can assist the pilot.

Currently assisted mode is only support when flying using a computer and
gamepad, not with a mobile device.

### The Z-ranger deck

The Z-ranger deck measures the distance to the ground and can be used
to automatically stay at a constant height, while the pilot can focus on the
position.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle)
and [Z-ranger deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/z-ranger-deck)

Note: the gamepad is not included

### The Flow deck

The Flow deck takes it even further by also detecting the motion of the Crazyflie
relative to the ground. This enables a flight mode where the pilot tells
the system which direction to go rather than the tilt of the quad copter, by
releasing the controls the Crazyflie simply stays hovering on the spot.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle)
and [Flow deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/flow-deck-v2)

Note: the gamepad is not included

## I want to add awareness of the surroundings to the Crazyflie

The Multi-ranger deck measures the distance to objects forward/back/left/right and up.
It can be used for obstacle avoidance, mapping a room or games where the
Crazyflie 2.X "bounces" between the walls of a room.
Combine with a Flow deck to measure the distance to the floor as well and
support autonomous flight.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle),
[Multi-ranger deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/multi-ranger-deck)
and [Flow deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/flow-deck-v2) or
[STEM ranging bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/stem-ranging-bundle)

## I want to use the Crazyflie 2.X for education

The Crazyflie is great for education, from younger kids getting acquainted with
robotics and computers up to university level.

### The STEM drone bundle

With the STEM drone bundle the Crayflie 2.X can fly autonomously using the Flow
deck and it can be controlled from a remote computer using simple python scripts,
perfect for getting started with robotics.
For higher education, students can for instance re-implement the controller
algorithms or similar for a real world robotics exercise. They can even bring
the equipment home for extended studies and insights.

**What to buy:** [STEM drone bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/stem-drone-bundle)

### The STEM ranging bundle

The STEM ranging bundle contains everything in the STEM drone bundle with the
addition of the Multi-ranger deck. The Multi-ranger makes it possible to interact
with the Crazyflie 2.X or use it to map a room.

**What to buy:** [STEM ranging bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/stem-ranging-bundle)

## I want to fly autonomously and control the Crazyflie 2.X from a computer

For fully autonomous flight the Crazyflie must get position data from an
external source, the internal sensors are only good for one or a few seconds of
flight. When the Crazyflie has more position information it is possible to
control it by using commands to tell it how to move or where to go, either from
an internal progam or from an external computer.

There are a number of option of how to provide position information and they
all have different properties.

### The Flow deck

With the Flow deck the Crazyflie gets the distance to, and the relative
motion relative to the surface under it. With this information it can hover
in one spot or follow a trajectory. The advantage of this solution is that it
does not require any external systems and comes at a very good price.

Since the position information is relative the Crazyflie does not really know
where it is and any motion will be based on the starting position. Further more
the position will drift over time, but in most cases autonomous flight can be
maintained up to a minute.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle)
and [Flow deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/flow-deck-v2)

### The Lighthouse positioning System

The Lighthouse positioning system is based on the SteamVR basestation. It offers
good accuracy and very good precision tracking. The Crazyflie pose is calculated
in the Crazyflie itself, which allows to develop completely autonomous flight.
The precision is in the millimeter range and the accuracy in the decimeter range.
The lighthouse positioning is well suited to implement tracking in small indoor
space.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundles](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle), [Lighthouse positioning deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/lighthouse-positioning-deck) and one or two [SteamVR Basestation 2.0](https://www.vive.com/us/accessory/base-station2/)

### The Loco Positioning System

With the Loco Positioning system the Crazyflie calculates its absolute position in
space, and it is all done in the Crazyflie! With the absolute position it
always knows where it is and since the position estimation is done in the drone
it is also possible to fly truly autonomously without a connection to an external
computer. The location precision of the loco positioning system is about +/-10cm.

**What to buy:** [Indoor Explorer bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/indoor-explorer-bundle)

### Camera based system

Positioning systems that use external cameras (often called MoCap)
such as solutions from Qualisys or Vicon can be used to
measure the position of a Crazyflie with high precision. In these systems the
position is calculated in an external computer and either the position or commands
for pitch/roll/yaw/thrust must be sent to the Crazyflie in real time via radio.
Depending of the camera system and its configuration the location precision of
a camera motion tracking system can be down to millimeters.

## I want to fly a swarm

Swarm flight with the Crazyflie is similar to autonomous flight with the added
complexity of positioning multiple drones simultaneously and making sure they
move along trajectories that avoid collisions. There are some support in the
system for swarms but this requires a lot of understanding and at least some
coding, depending on solution.

Again, a key to swarming is the positioning technology and its properties.

### The Lighthouse Positioning system

The lighthouse positioning system is a good fit for swarms since it offers high precision
and the position is acquired in the Crazyflie itself. This removes the need to
setup an extra high-reliability low-latency link to transfer all the Crazyflie
positions from a more traditional external tracking system.

**What to buy:** [Getting started bundles](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle), [Lighthouse positioning deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/lighthouse-positioning-deck) and one or two [SteamVR Basestation 2.0](https://www.vive.com/us/accessory/base-station2/)

### The Loco Positioning System

The default mode (Two way ranging) of the Loco Positioning system supports
positioning of only one Crazyflie so to position multiple Crazyflies the system must
be switched to the TDoA mode. The TDoA mode works like an
indoor GPS system where the Crazyflies only listens to positioning information from the
anchors which makes it possible to position a large number of drones.
Due to the nature of TDoA the position estimation works best in the space
inside the anchors (the convex hull) and we recommend using 8 anchors for TDoA.

**What to buy:** [Indoor Explorer bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/indoor-explorer-bundle),
2 x [Loco positioning node](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/loco-positioning-node),
[Crazyflies](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1),
[Loco Positioning decks](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/loco-positioning-deck) or [Swarm bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/the-swarm-bundle)

### Camera based system

Camera based systems such as solutions from Qualisys or Vicon can track many markers
simultaneously. To identify individual Crazyflies different physical configurations of
markers can be used on each individual or an external system can keep track of
the motion of markers to understand which drone that is connected to a marker.
Again the position is calculated in an external computer and either the position or commands
for pitch/roll/yaw/thrust must be sent to the Crazyflies in real time via radio.
There are frameworks (for examle [Crazy Swarm](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm)) written by the community to handle these types of system and
swarms of up to 50 Crazyflies.

**What to buy:** We do not sell Motion Capture systems, however some accessories are dedicated to it like the [Motion capture marker deck
](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/positioning/products/motion-capture-marker-deck) and the [Active Marker deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/positioning/products/active-marker-deck).
