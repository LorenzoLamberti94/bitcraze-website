{% row_image_text_links I want to record data when flying my Crazyflie 2.X %}
{% row_text %}
If large volumes of data needs to be recorded when flying, the Crazyradio PA might
not have sufficient bandwidth in some cases. The SD-card deck adds access to the
filesystem of a SD card and enables storage of any data.
{% endrow_text %}
{% row_links %}
**What to buy:**

* [SD-card deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/sd-card-deck)

Note: SD card is not included
{% endrow_links %}
{% endrow_image_text_links %}


{% row_image_text_links I want to use a SD-card for configuration of a Crazyflie %}
{% row_text %}
The SD-card deck can be used to store configuration data for a Crazyflie. An
example could be an autonomous implementation where the Crazyflie is not connected
via radio. The configuration can be written to a SD-card in a computer and the
SD-card is transferred to the Crazyflie before it is started. This is also a
way to separate configuration from hardware/firmware and avoid flashing
different firmware to Crazyflie individuals.
{% endrow_text %}
{% row_links %}
**What to buy:**

* [SD-card deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/sd-card-deck)

Note: SD card is not included
{% endrow_links %}
{% endrow_image_text_links %}


{% row_image_text_links I want assistance when flying the Crazyflie %}
{% row_text %}
Flying a quadcopter like the Crazyflie manually requires some skill and
practising. By adding the Z-ranger deck or Flow deck the Crazyflie gets more
information about its motion and can assist the pilot.

The Z-ranger deck measures the distance to the ground and can be used
to automatically stay at a constant height, while the pilot can focus on the
position.

The Flow deck takes it even further by also detecting the motion of the Crazyflie
relative to the ground. This enables a flight mode where the pilot tells
the system which direction to go rather than the tilt of the quad copter, by
releasing the controls the Crazyflie simply stays hovering on the spot.

Currently assisted mode is only support when flying using a computer and
gamepad, not with a mobile device.

## I want to fly autonomously and control the Crazyflie 2.X from a computer

For fully autonomous flight the Crazyflie must get position data from an
external source, the internal sensors are only good for one or a few seconds of
flight. When the Crazyflie has more position information it is possible to
control it by using commands to tell it how to move or where to go, either from
an internal progam or from an external computer.

There are a number of option of how to provide position information and they
all have different properties.
{% endrow_full %}


{% row_image_text_links The Flow deck %}
{% row_text %}
With the Flow deck the Crazyflie gets the distance to, and the relative
motion relative to the surface under it. With this information it can hover
in one spot or follow a trajectory. The advantage of this solution is that it
does not require any external systems and comes at a very good price.

Since the position information is relative the Crazyflie does not really know
where it is and any motion will be based on the starting position. Further more
the position will drift over time, but in most cases autonomous flight can be
maintained up to a minute.

{% row_image_text_links The Lighthouse positioning System %}
{% row_text %}
The Lighthouse positioning system is based on the Lighthouse base station. It offers
good accuracy and very good precision tracking. The Crazyflie pose is calculated
in the Crazyflie itself, which allows to develop completely autonomous flight.
The precision is in the millimeter range and the accuracy in the decimeter range.
The lighthouse positioning is well suited to implement tracking in small indoor
space.

{% endrow_links %}
{% endrow_image_text_links %}


{% row_image_text_links The Loco Positioning System %}
{% row_text %}
With the Loco Positioning system the Crazyflie calculates its absolute position in
space, and it is all done in the Crazyflie! With the absolute position it
always knows where it is and since the position estimation is done in the drone
it is also possible to fly truly autonomously without a connection to an external
computer. The location precision of the loco positioning system is about +/-10cm.
{% endrow_text %}

**What to buy:**

* [Indoor Explorer bundle](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/indoor-explorer-bundle)
{% endrow_links %}
{% endrow_image_text_links %}


{% row_image_text_links Motion Capture System %}
{% row_text %}
Positioning systems that use external cameras (often called MoCap)
such as solutions from Qualisys or Vicon can be used to
measure the position of a Crazyflie with high precision. In these systems the
position is calculated in an external computer and either the position or commands
for pitch/roll/yaw/thrust must be sent to the Crazyflie in real time via radio.
Depending of the camera system and its configuration the location precision of
a camera motion tracking system can be down to millimeters.

## I want to fly a swarm

Swarm flight with the Crazyflie is similar to autonomous flight with the added
complexity of positioning multiple drones simultaneously and making sure they
move along trajectories that avoid collisions. There are some support in the
system for swarms but this requires a lot of understanding and at least some
coding, depending on solution.

Again, a key to swarming is the positioning technology and its properties.
{% endrow_full %}


{% row_image_text_links The Lighthouse Positioning system %}
{% row_text %}
The lighthouse positioning system is a good fit for swarms since it offers high precision
and the position is acquired in the Crazyflie itself. This removes the need to
setup an extra high-reliability low-latency link to transfer all the Crazyflie
positions from a more traditional external tracking system.
{% endrow_text %}
{% row_links %}
**What to buy:**

* [Getting started bundles](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/getting-started-bundle)
* [Lighthouse positioning deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/lighthouse-positioning-deck)
* one or two [Lighthouse base station V2](https://store.bitcraze.io/products/lighthouse-v2-base-station)
{% endrow_links %}
{% endrow_image_text_links %}


{% row_image_text_links The Loco Positioning System %}
{% row_text %}
The default mode (Two way ranging) of the Loco Positioning system supports
positioning of only one Crazyflie so to position multiple Crazyflies the system must
be switched to the TDoA mode. The TDoA mode works like an
indoor GPS system where the Crazyflies only listens to positioning information from the
anchors which makes it possible to position a large number of drones.
Due to the nature of TDoA the position estimation works best in the space
inside the anchors (the convex hull) and we recommend using 8 anchors for TDoA.

{% row_image_text_links MoCap System %}
{% row_text %}
Camera based systems such as solutions from Qualisys or Vicon can track many markers
simultaneously. To identify individual Crazyflies different physical configurations of
markers can be used on each individual or an external system can keep track of
the motion of markers to understand which drone that is connected to a marker.
Again the position is calculated in an external computer and either the position or commands
for pitch/roll/yaw/thrust must be sent to the Crazyflies in real time via radio.
There are frameworks (for examle [Crazy Swarm](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm)) written by the community to handle these types of system and
swarms of up to 50 Crazyflies.
