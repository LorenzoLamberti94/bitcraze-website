The Motion capture marker deck makes it easy to attach reflective markers to a
Crazyflie for tracking in a motion capture system. The markers are tracked by
cameras in the motion capture system and the system uses the information to calculate
the current position of the Crazyflie. The position can be used for precise
measurements or can be fed back to the Crazyflie for autonomous flight.

This deck is developed in collaboration with [Qualisys](https://www.qualisys.com)
