Get audio feedback and get creative by composing and playing your own melodies.

Sometimes LED feedback isn't enough, like when you're flying around in a lab and living room. With the
buzzer deck you'll get audio feedback on system events, like low battery or
charging completed.
Or why not create your own melodies that will play while you're buzzing around. If you're tapped out on creativity there are already a few
melodies pre-programmed that you can use.
