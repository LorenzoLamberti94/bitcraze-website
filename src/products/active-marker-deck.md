Long distance and solid tracking;
Compatible with Qualisys tracking systems and QTM
%}

The active marker deck together with Qualisys QTM gives you long distance and solid tracking. Thanks to the 4 high-power LEDs you can set up to 4
different IDs giving you the possibility to uniqly identify a large number of rigid bodies, without the need of many reflective markers.

The hardware comes pre-programmed for Qualisys tracking systems, but can be re-programmed for other applications.
