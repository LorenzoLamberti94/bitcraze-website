Add lights to your Crazyflie 2.X;
Light up the dark with custom patterns using the Crazyflie 2.X LED-ring expansion deck.
%}

Featuring 12 powerful RGB LEDs facing downwards, you can
create custom patterns in firmware that you control from your computer.
Two additional strong front facing LEDs can be switched on and off to
act as headlights.

The color and light sequence of the LED-ring can be controlled from your client
while in flight. Why not show starboard/port with red and green colors or paint
with light in the dark?

The LED-ring expansion deck is designed for mounting under the Crazyflie 2.X
facing downwards.
