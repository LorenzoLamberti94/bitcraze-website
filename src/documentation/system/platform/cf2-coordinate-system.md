---

This page shows the coordinate system used in the **[Crazyflie 2.X family]({% id_url overview_crazyflie %})**. The global coordinate system (X, Y, Z) is in the EAST NORTH UP (ENU) convention, as is the body fixed (local) coordinate system (x, y, z). The attitude angles roll, pitch and yaw (φ, θ, ψ) are in the following rotation rules
* __roll__ and __yaw__ are clockwise rotating around the axis looking from the origin (right-hand-thumb)
* __pitch__ are counter-clockwise rotating around the axis looking from the origin (left-hand-thumb)
