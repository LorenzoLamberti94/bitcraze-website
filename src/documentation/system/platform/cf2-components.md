1.  **LED 1**: Red/green LED used for heartbeat and low-battery
    indication
2.  **LED 2**: Blue LED fully lit when powered and blinking when
    bootloading
3.  **LED 3**: Blue LED fully lit when powered and blinking when
    charging
4.  **LED 4**: Red/green LED used to indicate radio communication
5.  **Right expansion connector**: The expansion port is used to
    connect expansion boards, either on the top and/or the bottom
6.  **Left expansion connector**: The expansion port is used to
    connect expansion boards, either on the top and/or the bottom
7.  **Expansion board orientation indicator**: This indicator
    should match the expansion boards
8.  **User button**: Push button used to power on/off the system.
    Hold down 3s while powering on to enter bootloader mode. Hold down
    10s while powering to enter STM32F4 DFU mode.
9.  **nRF51822**: The nRF51822 micro controller
10. **Mounting holes**: Can be used for mechanically mounting
    something to the platform. The holes are plated, can be grounded by
    soldering a bridge and are 2mm in diameter (with plating)
