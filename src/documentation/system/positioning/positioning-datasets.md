This page contains links to datasets for various positioning systems. The intention is to make it possible
to analyze data to quantify the accuracy and performance of different systems.

## Multiple system types

[Lighthouse Positioning System: Dataset, Accuracy, and Precision for UAV Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11523)

[bitcraze/positioning_dataset on github](https://github.com/bitcraze/positioning_dataset) - data for multiple types
of positioning systems.
