## An affordable positioning system for your research and classes
------

The lighthouse system is our latest high-precision method of positioning on the Crazyflie 2.X. The [Lighthouse Base Stations](https://store.bitcraze.io//products/lighthouse-v2-base-station/) emit infrared light which is detected by our {% poplink lighthouse-deck %}. This enables the crazyflie to calculate its own position on board.
