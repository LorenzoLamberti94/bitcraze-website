The {% poplink breakout-deck %} is designed to be soldered to 100mil breadboard or prototyping board.
The aim is to ease prototyping by connecting breadboard circuits to Crazyflie 2.0.
It can also be used to make a bigger system using Crazyflie 2.0 as a component.
The breakout board is also very useful to measure signals, for example by sticking
oscilloscope probes in the 100mil connector holes.

The deck is shipped without a 100mil connector. To be used on a breadboard 100mil 10 pin male
should be soldered.

The 100mil connector is cabled directly to the expansion port connectors.
