## Let's get started!

If you just bought a Crazyflie 2.X a good way to start is to head over to the
{% id_link getting-started-crazyflie-2 %} guide
to see how to assemble the kit and take off for your first flight. If you want to add one of our many expansion decks to the Crazyflie 2.X and need help getting started we have made a {% id_link getting-started-expansion-decks %} tutorial. Just follow the steps and you are ready to go.

Just bought our Loco positioning system? Go to our [Loco Positioning system
page](/products/loco-positioning-system/) for more information and how to setup the system.

We have collected all getting started guides in the Tutorials menu, this is the
place to look for instructions.

## Development

When you are comfortable flying the Crazyflie you might feel that it is time for
the next step, to make use of the flexibility of the platform. After all it is
designed to be modified! Check out the {% id_link getting-started-development %}
tutorial to setup your development environment, build your first custom firmware and
download it to the copter.

Maybe you want to add a sensor or some other hardware? Heat up your soldering
iron and dive into it! Find more information about the [expansion bus](/documentation/system/platform/cf2-expansiondecks/). The [documentation](/documentation/system/)
is the place to look for documentation related to products and projects.

All the source code is hosted on [github.com/bitcraze](https://github.com/bitcraze)
and this is also where you will find documentation related to each repository.

## Projects

Looking for inspiration for a new project? Take a look at our [blog posts](/blog/). The {% id_link videogallery %} contains
some really cool stuff as well as our [You Tube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BitcrazeVideos). We also have a [list of academic groups](/portals/research/) that have used the Crazyflie in their research.

## Contribute!

Open source is about sharing, creating something awesome together and contribute
to the greater good! It is easy, fun and anyone can do it, read more about [how to contribute](/development/contribute/).
