## Open Roles

### Developer - hardware and product development

We are currently looking for a software developer with interests in hardware and product development to join our team.

We are looking for people that share our interest for techy stuff but that also adds new areas they are passionate about.

As we don’t have any fixed role at Bitcraze, your job is subject to change over the week based on the areas you have expertise and passion in.

#### Your role
Here are a few items that you’re susceptible to work with on a daily basis:
* Hardware and supply chain management, making sure things are ready in time for the right price and shipped to the right place.
* Technical support, such as answering questions (that range from basic tech support to detailed and complex issues) and helping members of the community.
* Add to and improve the codebase of all the software we have, firmware, python libs and clients
* Create future products (hardware and software) as well as improve current products

#### You as a person

You should be heavily interested in hardware, software and tech in general. You are open-minded and curious about all
aspects of running a business. Most of all, you’re a passionate person that communicates well, loves teamwork and is
not afraid to take initiatives. We’re looking for someone who is ready to make a long term commitment, and we’re offering
broad possibilities for someone that’s ready to take on a lot of new challenges.

As a programmer, you are fluent in C or Python, and possibly some other languages as well.


### Part-time job in our warehouse

Bitcraze is looking for one more team member, someone flexible that can help us with small tasks - mainly packing and shipping of orders.

#### Your role
We are looking for someone to help out in packing and shipping orders. The position is part-time, a few half days per week.

#### You as a person
You should be good at setting up a simple routine and follow it precisely. The task can be repetitive and it’s something you have to like. In exchange, you can choose your schedule - you can come in 1 or 2 hours before or after your studies, at least 3 days a week. You love independence and can take initiative.
You have great attention to details and are reliable - it’s important to us that the customers get their orders in good condition, with care and attention taken to their package.
You need this extra job for at least a year.

You should be reliable, responsible and flexible.
The company’s working language is English, so you should be fluent.
Interests in technology is a plus.

## About Bitcraze

Important to note is that we are not like most other companies.
We don't have any titles or fixed roles, in fact we are completely
self organized and we do not have any managers. In our universe the success of
the team is more important than personal gain, we do not blame - we help. We are
continuously building the company we want to work in, and base it on the idea that
no one in the company can tell anyone else what to do. This might sound a bit
unusual but the truth is that we have a way of working (some might call it a
process) that is pretty elaborate and detailed and that solves our daily
problems, but never hinders us. After all, the reality is more important than the plan.

### Location
We are located in Malmö, Sweden. Even though there are a lot of really good
on-line collaboration tools, we prefer human contact and we are not interested in remote
work solutions. You will have to be prepared to move to Malmö.

Unfortunately we do not have the capacity to handle applications from outside
the EU due to visa and work permit administration.

### Language
We use English in our everyday work.

### Contact
If you think you would fit in at Bitcraze and would add value to the company
and our projects, please drop us an email at jobs@bitcraze.io and tell us who
you are.

## Areas we work with

We have tried to collect an overview of all the tasks we work with at Bitcraze in this section. As an employee you will
probably work on several of these areas from time to time, we are a small company and we are all ready to help out where needed.

#### Technical support
Answer questions and help members of the community through emails, the discussions,
GitHub issues, the store and other communication channels. Questions range from
basic tech support such as how to install the client, to detailed and
complex issues.

#### Product development
Create future products, hardware and software as well as improve current
products. We make a lot of prototypes to try new ideas out, most of
them never reach the outside world though. We also add to and improve the codebase
of the all the software we have, firmware, python libs and clients.

#### The shop, stock management and logistics
We have our own E-store and use a 3PL service for warehousing and fulfillment
of orders. There's always things to do here and it
ranges from pre-sales support and quotes to missing packages and delays or finding
a better payment gateway etc. Most of our sales have been B2C but we're moving more
and more towards B2B.

#### Production and supply chain
If there's one thing we've learned over the years is that production never just
rolls on and works. We manufacture a lot of products and we have more coming.
Making sure things are ready in time for the right price and shipped to the
right place takes a lot of work.

#### Internal and external systems
Maintaining and developing systems such as the web, discussions, build servers,
supply chain tracking tools and similar.

#### Business development, strategy and the future
Sometimes we solve detailed problems in the code but at other times we have to bring
out the wider brush and think about the bigger picture. Who are we, really?
How do we fit into the rest of the world? Why do we do what we do? How do want
to make money in the future?

#### Admin and finance
Handling receipts, salaries, rent, book keeping, audits and so on for our company.
Keeping track of sales, costs and money i general to make sure we are on top of
the situation.

#### Community and marketing
Talk to the community, make videos to show what we do, write a blog post,
redesign the web, make us look sharp. Go to a faire or exhibition
and show our products and meet people.

#### External projects and collaboration
We have a few collaborations with external partners where we design custom
solutions, hardware and software.
