We have exhibited at IROS 2022 in Kyoto between 24-26 October. Here on this page we will show the videos and code of what we have used efore

## Decentralized Swarm Demo

What we have shown at our booth was a fully decentralized swarm demo where we showed of several items:

- **The [lighthouse positioning system]({% id_url lighthouse-system-overview %}) for onboard positioning**: We have showed these a couple of times but now we were able to fly with the latest improvements (see [this blogpost](/2022/03/multiple-base-stations-with-lighthouse/)).
- **Peer to peer communication**: The crazyflies were communicating with eachother with the [peer to peer](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/functional-areas/p2p_api/) functionality. This was used to indicate eachothers state and position. Here they arrange together who will take off and who will not.
- **Inter drone avoidance**: The p2p position sharing was used for in air obstacle avoidance with eachother. This is using the collision avoidance module written by James Preiss of University of Southern California (see this [PR](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/pull/628)).

The ground work for this awesome demo was done by our 2022 summer intern Marios Stamatopoulos who has written more details in his [blogpost](/2022/08/our-intern-marios-summer-work-on-swarms/). 

The [source code of the demo](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware-experimental/tree/iros-2022/examples/demos/decentralized_swarm) can be found on github of the [crazyflie-firmware-experimental](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware-experimental/) under the _iros-2022_ branch

## Tech meetup

Don't miss our tech meetup!

If you’re at IROS and want to meet us together with other Crazyflie users, then let’s get together on Monday 24th of
October at 16.00 at our booth 59. It’s the perfect occasion to (re)connect, to get the latest news about Bitcraze,
to talk about development, share what you’ve been doing and even possibly hack together! Be sure to say hi if you’re
there!

## New products

We will bring some of the prototypes that are cooking in the Bitcraze pots at the moment.

## Demo

There will of course be a demo and this time it will be based on [Marios's work](/2022/08/our-intern-marios-summer-work-on-swarms/),
a fully autonomous swarm with peer to peer communication and distributed decision making.
