We will exhibit at IROS 2022 in Kyoto between 24-26 October, you can find us in both 59.

Drop by and say hi, check out the demo and tell us what you are working on.
We love to hear about all the interesting projects that are going on. See you there!

## Tech meetup

Don't miss our tech meetup!

If you’re at IROS and want to meet us together with other Crazyflie users, then let’s get together on Monday 24th of
October at 16.00 at our booth 59. It’s the perfect occasion to (re)connect, to get the latest news about Bitcraze,
to talk about development, share what you’ve been doing and even possibly hack together! Be sure to say hi if you’re
there!

## New products

We will bring some of the prototypes that are cooking in the Bitcraze pots at the moment.

## Demo

There will of course be a demo and this time it will be based on [Marios's work](/2022/08/our-intern-marios-summer-work-on-swarms/),
a fully autonomous swarm with peer to peer communication and distributed decision making.
