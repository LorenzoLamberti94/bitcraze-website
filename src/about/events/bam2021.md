We're really excited and lucky to welcome all those speakers to talk about drone development. The program is not entirely fixed yet, some surprise guests should turn up. You can also still add your input by filling [our interest form](https://forms.gle/3GPG3dj1Ud1RG52Q6) to have an influence on the content. *(Note that the google form is not a signup, as that is done through the above link in EventBrite)*
