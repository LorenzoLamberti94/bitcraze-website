Introducing the **Bitcraze Awesome Meetup (BAM) days**: a free, three-day convention celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Bitcraze. The program is organized around three themes: **Positioning, the AI-deck and Swarming**.

There will be guest speakers, workshops, Q&As and most-importantly... social events. We hope to meet you there, hear what you are working on and discuss future possibilties of what we can achieve with the Crazyflie eco system!
