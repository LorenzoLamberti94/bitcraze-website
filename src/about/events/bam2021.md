Introducing the **Bitcraze Awesome Meetup (BAM) days**: a free, three-day convention celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Bitcraze. The program is organized around three themes: **Positioning, the AI-deck and Swarming**.

There will be guest speakers, workshops, Q&As and most-importantly... social events. We hope to meet you there, hear what you are working on and discuss future possibilties of what we can achieve with the Crazyflie eco system!

Title Presentation: "Fully autonomous CrazyFlie swarms"

{% collapse_section Read more %}

Abstract: Swarms of autonomous drones can help humans in search-and-rescue missions, in keeping track of the stock in warehouses or in monitoring crop in greenhouses. We are convinced that such complex tasks can and even should be performed by drones the size of BitCraze's CrazyFlies. Tiny drones like the CrazyFlie are very safe for humans, suitable for flying in narrow environments, and quite cheap so that they can be produced in large numbers. However, it is also notoriously hard to make such tiny drones fly completely autonomously. Due to their extremely low weight, they are very limited in terms of energy and payload. This implies that they can carry few sensors and extremely little processing compared to, e.g., self-driving cars. In our talk, we will talk about the effort at TU Delft's MAVLab to make swarms of tiny autonomous drones, and how we approach this by drawing inspiration from insect intelligence. We will present our work on ultra-light autonomous drones such as the 20 gram "DelFly Explorer". Our focus will be on swarming, and on making tiny drones localize with respect to the other swarm members. We will also talk about two different studies in which swarms of Crazyflies perform incredibly complex tasks. In the first study, a swarm of CrazyFlies is able to explore an unknown environment and come back to the departure point. In the second study, a swarm of CrazyFlies is able to autonomously localize gas sources in complex environments. In our talk we argue that CrazyFlie drones will turn out to be useful far beyond motion tracking arenas.

Bio:

Guido de Croon: Received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Maastricht University, the Netherlands. His research interest lies with computationally efficient, bio-inspired algorithms for robot autonomy, with an emphasis on computer vision. Since 2008 he has worked on algorithms for achieving autonomous flight with small and light-weight flying robots, such as the DelFly flapping wing MAV. In 2011-2012, he was a research fellow in the Advanced Concepts Team of the European Space Agency, where he studied topics such as optical flow based control algorithms for extraterrestrial landing scenarios. After his return at TU Delft, his work has included fully autonomous flight of a 20-gram DelFly, a new theory on active distance perception with optical flow, and a swarm of tiny drones able to explore unknown environments. Currently, he is Full Professor at TU Delft and scientific lead of the Micro Air Vehicle lab (MAVLab) of Delft University of Technology

Bio: 

Bart Duisterhof received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. His interests lie in efficient algorithms for robot autonomy of tiny flying machines. From 2016 to 2020 he worked with Professor Guido de Croon, first exploring visual servoing of the DelFly Nimble, a 30-gram flapping wing MAV. Later they contributed the first fully autonomous swarm of gas-seeking nano quadcopters, Sniffy Bug. In 2019 Bart was a visiting research fellow at Harvard University, where he studied applications of deep reinforcement learning on nano drones. He is currently a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University.

### Workshops & Demos

*We will also give workshops about the inner workings of the Bitcraze Ecosystem and all beyond! Join if you want to learn more of what makes the Crazyflie tick!*

<center><h4>Day 1</h4></center>

#### Crazyflie and Positioning Systems {#ps}

We will give a basic introduction to different position systems, how they work and how they fit into the Crazyflie ecosystem. Using different demos we will also be looking at how the Crazyflie performs using different positioning systems as well as some of the strengths and weaknesses of the different technologies. If you’re interested in positioning with the Crazyflie you should definitely join this session!

#### Advanced Lighthouse Usage {#al}

If you have already gone through [the lighthouse tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-lighthouse/), but you would like know what really goes on behind the scenes? In this workshop we will give more advanced knowledge about our newest positioning system. From the Base station's machanics, calibration & geometry estimation, to using Lighthouse Positioning system in a swarm: we will go through it all!

<center><h4>Day 2</h4></center>

#### RUST and the Crazyflie {#ru}

Rust is an exciting, relatively new programming language that promises performance, reliability and productivity. It is starting to become quite popular for system programming and we believe it might finaly be the modern language that can replace C in embedded systems. In this workshop we will quickly go over the language and the different use we can have for it in the Crazyflie ecosystem. Then, we will write the push demo Crazyflie App in Rust to explore how rust can be used in the Crazyflie firmware.

#### Autonomy and the App layer {#aa}

If you want the Crazyflie to fly by itself without any manual involvement, it is important to know the different layers of autonomy and its influence on the communication between the computer and the drone. The App-layer, the ability to have a fully autonomous Crazyflie without any PC communication at all, will be especially highlighted in this workshop. Finally, we will give you some crucial tips on how plan your workflow from abstract ideas to actual autonomous flight.

<center><h4>Day 3</h4></center>


#### Swarming with the CFlib {#sc}

Controlling a swarm with the cflib, is it possible? And if so, when should you do it? This talk will showcase what the Bitcraze Python library offers in terms of swarm control and what limitations the Python code put on multi-peer communication. We will also show you a demo of swarm flight implemented using under 100 lines of code.

#### Bolt and BQ deck {#bb}

You think the payload capability of the Crazyflie 2.1 is not enough, then the BigQuad deck or Bolt could be the solution for you. We will talk about the design and how to get something bigger into the air as well as future work.

#### Autonomous Swarm Demo {#as}

The demo is still a suprise, but we can tell you already: you do not want to miss this!
