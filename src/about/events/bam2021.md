Introducing the **Bitcraze Awesome Meetup (BAM) days**: a free, three-day convention celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Bitcraze. The program is organized around three themes: **Positioning, the AI-deck and Swarming**.

There will be guest speakers, workshops, Q&As and most-importantly... social events. We hope to meet you there, hear what you are working on and discuss future possibilties of what we can achieve with the Crazyflie eco system!

Bio:

Wolfgang Hönig is an independent junior research group leader at TU Berlin, Germany, heading the Intelligent Multi-Robot Coordination Lab. Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology, USA. He received the diploma in Computer Science from TU Dresden, Germany in 2012, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Southern California (USC), USA in 2016 and 2019, respectively. His research focuses on enabling large teams of physical robots to collaboratively solve real-world tasks, using tools from informed search, optimization, and machine learning. Wolfgang has been using the Crazyflie since 2014, co-developed the Crazyswarm to fly up to 49 Crazyflies in 2016, and was a visiting research scientist at Bitcraze in 2021.

### Workshops & Demos

*We will also give workshops about the inner workings of the Bitcraze Ecosystem and all beyond! Join if you want to learn more of what makes the Crazyflie tick!*

<center><strong>Day 1</strong></center>

#### Crazyflie and Positioning Systems {#ps}

Here we will present the role of positionig systems in our Crazyflie Ecosystem. If you are unclear about what exactly the difference is between the Lighthouse or Loco positioning system, or what global or relative positioning means, you should probably join!

#### Advanced Lighthouse Usage {#al}

If you have already gone through [the lighthouse tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-lighthouse/), but you would like know what goes behind the scenes of the Lighthouse tab's buttons? In this workshop we will give more advanced knowledge about our newest positioning system.

<center><strong>Day 2</strong></center>

#### RUST and the Crazyflie {#ru}

A few of us are passionate about RUST and would like others of the Crazyflie community to be that as well. Here we will explain some of the current RUST projects that are going on within Bitcraze!

#### Autonomy and the App layer {#aa}

This workshop explores the different levels of autonomy that can be achieved on the crazyflie. We will also explain how to make an Crazyflie fly without an Computer with Crazyradio attached, with the app layer functionality.

<center><strong>Day 3</strong></center>


#### Swarming with the CFlib {#sc}

Most users are using Crazyswarm for controlling their swarm of Crazyflies, however it is possible to do this from the CFlib as well. Here we explain how this is implemented within the Python library and show some demostrations as well.

#### Bolt and BQ deck {#bb}

Bigger + stronger + better: how to make a bigger drone with the Bolt and Bigquad deck.

#### Autonomous Swarm Demo {#as}

The demo is still a suprise, but we can tell you now, you do not want to miss this!
