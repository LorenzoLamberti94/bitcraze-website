This is the video 'Getting Started on the Crazyflie' presentation that Bitcraze gave for 2023 'Aerial Robotics' course as part of the Master in  [Master in Robotics Colloquium of EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/). We were invited by Dario Floreano of the [EPFL-LIS lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/) to introduce the students to the Crazyflie 2.1, the flow-deck and Multi ranger, and how to achieve autonomy. This lecture also introduces using simulation for the development process
