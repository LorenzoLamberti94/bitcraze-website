### Virtual Machine:
For this workshop we have made a [Bitcraze VM with AIdeck development environment](https://storage.googleapis.com/bitcraze-share/vm/BitcrazeVM_aideck.ova) (10Gb). This VM has already preconfigured docker images for flashing both the GAP8 and the NINA chip. All you need to do is to cd to your examples (like 'cd projects/AIdeck_examples/GAP8/test_functionalities/test_camera') and type the following command:
- If you want to try out the code on RAM only: 	'gap_run'
- If you want to flash the gap8:               	'gap_flash'

To reflash the NINA, go to 'AIdeck_examples/NINA/firmware' and type:
- To configure and flash the Nina: 		'nina_flash'

These commands are configured ~/.bashrc. Also check if the configured programmer file in the same script matches yours!

If you rather want to install the gap_sdk natively (only Ubuntu), please follow the [gap_sdk instructions](https://greenwaves-technologies.com/manuals/BUILD/HOME/html/index.html) by Greenwaves Technologies. Make sure to also have gap_tools installed and to do this ahead of time of the workshop as it takes about an hour to set-it-up.

#### The whole workshop will be recorded and available (with slides) on this page after the event!
