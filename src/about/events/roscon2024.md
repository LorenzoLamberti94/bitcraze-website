We will be going to ROSCon 2024, Odense Denmark on the October 22th and 23rd! We will be located at booth **21**.


## ROS 2 Swarm Mapping demo

What we will show  shown at our booth was a fully decentralized swarm demo where we showed of several items:

- **The [lighthouse positioning system]({% id_url lighthouse-system-overview %}) for onboard positioning**: This is are default demo setup for conference and fair booths.
- **Multiranger based swarm mapping in ROS2**: We are using the Crazyswarm2 project and a multiranger mapping ROS 2 node to create a map of the environment with 3 crazyflies at the same time.

THe Multiranger based swarm mapping is based on the skill learning session given at the [Robotics Developer Day](https://www.theconstruct.ai/robotics-developers-day/) and based on what is done for the [tutorial written in this blogpost](https://www.bitcraze.io/2024/09/crazyflies-adventures-with-ros-2-and-gazebo/).


### Video of Demo

### Products used in the demo

The following products are used in the demo, are available for purchase in
[our store](https://store.bitcraze.io/).

#### The Crazyflie 2.1

The {% id_link product-crazyflie-2-1 %}
is a small, flexible quadrotor, suitable for research and education. The small
size and light weight makes it safe and robust if crashing, while the open source
software opens up the possibility to modify or examine any part of the functionality.

#### The Lighthouse positioning system

The {% id_link lighthouse-system-overview %}
is based on the Valve Lighthouse base stations,
used in the SteamVR gaming kit. It has very high precision and
accuracy to an affordable price, making it possible to use in any office or
class room. The position is estimated in the Crazyflie quadrotor which makes the system
robust and easy to use.

#### The Multiranger deck

The {% poplink multi-ranger-deck %} gives the Crazyflie 2.x the ability to detect objects around it. This is done by measuring the distance to objects in the following 5 directions: front/back/left/right/up with mm precision up to 4 meters.

#### The Qi 1.2 wireless charging deck

The {% poplink qi-1-2-wireless-charging-deck %}
uses the same standard as mobile phones which
makes it easy to find a compatible charger.

#### The Crazyradio PA

The {% id_link product-crazyradio-pa %}
is a USB dongle radio that is used to communicate with the Crazyflie.
It supports up to 800 packets/s to multiple Crazyflies simultaneously.

#### The charging pad

The charging pads are based on the wireless charger "NORDMÃ„RKE" from [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/)
with a 3D-printed pad. The FreeCad and stl files for the pad are available on GitHub in
[Landing_pad_rallen_v5.fcstd](https://github.com/bitcraze/bitcraze-mechanics/blob/master/models/Landing_pad_rallen_v5.fcstd) and
[Landing_pad_v5.stl](https://github.com/bitcraze/bitcraze-mechanics/blob/master/models/Landing_pad_v5.stl).
