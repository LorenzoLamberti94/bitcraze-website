Open source is about sharing, creating something awesome together and contribute
to the greater good! Whenever you do something that you think someone else could
benefit from, please contribute it! If you were curious or confused about something,
someone else probably will too. Help them by sharing your thoughts, insights and
discoveries.

## Contributing in Github
The source code for firmware, clients, tools and the web site are hosted on [github](https://github.com/bitcraze).

### Issue tracking
When reporting github issues the more information you can supply the better.

* **Information about the environment**:
  * What version of the firmware are you running
  * If relevant, what are you using to control the Crazyflie. ie. What lib or client, and what version.
* **How to reproduce the issue**: Step-by-step guide on how the issue can be reproduced (or at least how you reproduce it). Include everything you think might be useful, the more information the better.

### Feature requests
If you are missing anything in terms of functioanlity, we and the community are continuously working to improve the firmware. Feel free to make an issue to request a new functionality!


### Pull Requests 
We use pull requests for code contributions, read more about how it works on
[this article github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Code Contributions are of great value to the project and we are very happy for any contribution, large or small,
but to make it possible for us to merge your additions into the codebase there are general guide-lines to follow:

* Describe the change
* Refer to any issues it effects
* Separate one pull request per functionality: if you start writing "and" in the feature description consider if it could be separated in two pull requests.
* The pull request must pass the automated testing

Please look at the general code contributing Guidelines and code standards for more information.

## Improving Documentation

The main documentation of this website is handled in its own repository on our [our github](https://github.com/bitcraze/bitcraze-website), so submit a pull request for your improvements.

The more detailed [repository documentation](/documentation/repository/) is hosted on this website but its source exists in the doc folders of the [repos on github](https://github.com/bitcraze) of which we also have several tips and tricks.
