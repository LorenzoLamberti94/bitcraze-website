to the greater good! Whenever you do something that you think someone else could
benefit from, please contribute it! If you were curious or confused about something,
someone else probably will too. Help them by sharing your thoughts, insights and
discoveries.

## Contributing in github

The source code for firmware, clients, tools and the web site are hosted on github.
We use pull requests for code contributions, read more about how it works on
[github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Contributions are of great value to the project and we are very happy for any contribution, large or small,
but to make it possible for us to merge your additions into the codebase there are a few rules to follow.
Please read the [general guidelines for code contributions](./general-guidelines.md) for more information.

There is also a contribute.md file in each project that describes the requirements in that
specific project when it comes to coding style, unit testing and so on.

## Writing repository documentation

The repository documentation is located in each repository, to make it easy to update when the
code is modified. Read the [repository documentation guidelines]({% id_url repo-doc-guidelines %})
for information on formatting, tools and how it works.
